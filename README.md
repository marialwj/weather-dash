## Weather Dashboard Project

## Overview

This weather dashboard project aims to provide users with a browser-based tool for checking the weather outlook for multiple cities. The application utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data and dynamically updates the HTML and CSS to present users with current and future weather conditions.

## User Story
As a traveler, I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that I can plan a trip accordingly.

## Acceptance Criteria
Given a weather dashboard with form inputs
When I search for a city
Then I am presented with current and future conditions for that city, and that city is added to the search history.
When I view current weather conditions for that city
Then I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed.
When I view future weather conditions for that city
Then I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.
When I click on a city in the search history
Then I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city.
